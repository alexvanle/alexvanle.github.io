                    <h2>A little about me...</h2>
                    <p>After I completed my two years of community college and obtained my degree in Business Administration. I heard about The Mississippi Coding Academy and took the opportunity to take advantage to learn more about coding. I am still learning and trying to perfect my craft everyday.  My goal is to obtain as much knowledge to get better as a software developer and be a full stack web developer. I hope to work under a great company and work on exciting projects.</p>

                            <h2>Creative</h2>
                            <p>I would like to think I have the qualities of a creative individual. I am capable of making a front-end web page look presentable to capture the audience's eyes. I am open-minded to think of all around aspects to incorporate any ideas to exceed the individual's liking. And I am very meticulous about every little detail and organization about the work I put out.</p>

                            <p>I am confident to believe that I know what fullfills the customer's unique needs. As someone who is still young and with the help of social media,I feel that I can understand what the youth's wants and needs. I will create content that will capture the audience's attention.</p>
